File contents:
	* ABUND - abundance of forest birds in patch

	* YR.ISOL - number of years since patch was isolated
	* DIST - distance to nearest patch (km)
	* LDIST - distance to nearest larger patch (km)
	* GRAZE - grazing intesity in patch (1 to 5 indicating light to heavy)
	* ALT - altitude (m above sealevel) of patch
	* L10DIST - log10 transformation of DIST
